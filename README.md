# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. Spend less time relying on the video guides to help building the code, more time developing and brainstorming how to problem solve
2. Organization in my CSS files and classes in each of them
3. Gaining more knowledge to become more flexible and improve my understanding of HTML
4. Always striving to make stylized and easy to access designs
